# Created for CS3240

__Name: Jason Lee__

__Position: UX/UI Designer__

I mainly worked on this project as the UX/UI designer, but was active in other areas as well. I collaborated with another teammate on the search function, and created the initial prototype of the shopping cart. I was the main player in creating the navigation bar, using and applying bootstrap on the rest of the website, and figured out several fixes that were necessary during the UX testing phase. I also added several tests so that the project would work correctly on Heroku, and was a large contributer to the email functionality.
